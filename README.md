1. Name: Wanda White
2. Overview: Project is to develop a website for a small company, Yarbrough Property Leasing. The owners want to "ease their pain" of not having their own website that showcases their business. They want their own website that can be accessed by potential tentants and past tenants (many of their tentants have leased from them multiple times) that will showcase their properties in a creative and professional manner. The information provided should include pictures, videos, monthly lease amount, address and availablity date. The site should allow the potential tentants to contact owner via email.

3. Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered:
    a) Potential tentants will access website through via internet by entering site address.
    b) Potential tentants will click on a link to search for a property (either single family or condominium).
    c) Potential tentants will view property information including address, lease amount and availablity date.
    d) Potential tentants will click on link to display a contact page where name, email address and comments can be entered. An email will be sent to owners.
    e) Potential tentants will click on link to view information about Yarbrough Property Leasing. Information provided will include owner names, number of years they have leased properties and the values defining the company/owners.

4. Technologies used: HTML,CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap (Carousel and grid) Fromspree, EsLint, Draw.IO, Github.

5. Ideas for future improvement: 
    a) Improve user experience by adding additional search criteria (for example, city/state or number of bedrooms).
    b) Reduce developer maintenance by eliminating hard coded information about properties by building a database to store property information. Develop a process that business owner could run weekly to load updated information to database.
    c) Improve user experience by adding more pictures and videos that showcase positive aspects about properties.
    d) Improve user experience by adding more information about the properties, including number of levels (example one story or two story property), type of garage/parking and type flooring.
